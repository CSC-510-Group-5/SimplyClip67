|.5|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code. | Animated Short video is hosted on repo. See - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYr_7qhdeLo <br> There is much more in readme that convinces people to work on code. <br> Developers Note - https://github.com/umagnanasundaram2128/SimplyClip#shipit-developers-note |
|.5|test cases exist  | There are number of unit test cases and automated test cases using selenium which covers 87.5% of the code |
