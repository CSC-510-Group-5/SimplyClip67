|.5|evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people) | .5|1. All the members of the team have set up environments setup locally. <br> 2. All used the same IDE, packages and tech stack to build the project. <br> 3. Everyone has installed the chrome extension and has been using it. |
|.5|evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base |.5|1. We assign issues in Github and start working on the required part of the project. <br> 2. The commit history of different members shows this. https://github.com/umagnanasundaram2128/SimplyClip/commits/main |
|1|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation)  |1| Every method, variables used in the files are properly documented. <br> See MD here - https://github.com/umagnanasundaram2128/SimplyClip/blob/final-docs/Docs/FUNCTION_DESCRIPTION.md <br> See Docx here - https://github.com/umagnanasundaram2128/SimplyClip/blob/main/Docs/function_description.docx <br> Also, Hosted Documenation a Site- https://umagnanasundaram2128.github.io/SimplyClip/ |

|1|issues are being closed |1|Closed 20 issues. <br> An open issue is closed only after verified by one of the members. <br> [Closed Issues](https://github.com/umagnanasundaram2128/SimplyClip/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
|.5|issues are discussed before they are closed |.5| After a team member fix the issue, a PR is raised, and the code is reviewed by one of the team members. If any issue is observed, it is communicated through comments in the issue. Once good to be closed, developer is tagged in order to notify. <br>  [Issues](https://github.com/umagnanasundaram2128/SimplyClip/issues)
|.5|Use of syntax checkers. |.5| ```eslint``` library automatically checks for programatic and syntax errors. There is config file for eslint in the project folder. <br> https://github.com/umagnanasundaram2128/SimplyClip/blob/main/.eslintrc.js <br> https://github.com/umagnanasundaram2128/SimplyClip#style-checker-and-analyzer |
|1|Issues reports: there are many  |1| Every developer has the extension installed in chrome. Initially there are quite a number of issues. Whenever an issue is seen, it is reported immediately and issue will be created in issues section and assigned to one who has recently worked in those areas of code where bug is seen. [Issues](https://github.com/umagnanasundaram2128/SimplyClip/issues)|
|.5|Use of code formatters. |.5|We used ```Prettier``` library to format the code in the project. <br> See README - https://github.com/umagnanasundaram2128/SimplyClip#prettier|
|.5|Use of style checkers |.5| Used Javascript standard style for style checking, this can be done using npm command. See README - https://github.com/umagnanasundaram2128/SimplyClip#style-checker-and-analyzer  |
|.5|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code. |.5| Animated Short video is hosted on repo. See - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYr_7qhdeLo <br> There is much more in readme that convinces people to work on code. <br> Developers Note - https://github.com/umagnanasundaram2128/SimplyClip#shipit-developers-note |
|.5|test cases exist  |.5| There are number of unit test cases and automated test cases using selenium which covers 88% of the code |
|.5|Use of code coverage  |.5| Used Selenium to test the code, and acheived code coverage of 88% |
|.5|other automated analysis tools  |.5| Used automated tools like Selenium for testing, and Github Workflow/Actions for CI/CD pipeline |
|.5|test cases:.a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases. |.5| We ensured that every part of the code works correctly by using selenium test suite. But Whenever a test case is failed an issue is added in the issues section [Issues](https://github.com/umagnanasundaram2128/SimplyClip/issues)|
|.5|test cases are routinely executed |.5| Github actions are used. After every commit to main branch, automated scripts are run for test cases and a badge is shown in the main project folder and README to indicate if build is successful|
