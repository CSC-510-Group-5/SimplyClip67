|Notes|Self Assessment| Evidence|
|-----|-|---------|
|Video|3||
|workload is spread over the whole team (so one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others...but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)|3|Work has been divided equally among all team members.Everyone has almost same number of commits.|
|Number of commits  |3|The number of commits can be sen in the repository.|
|Number of commits: by different people  |3|The number of commits are almost equal across all team members.|
|Issues reports: there are many  |3| Every developer has the extension installed in chrome. Initially there are quite a number of issues. Whenever an issue is seen, it is reported immediately and issue will be created in issues section and assigned to one who has recently worked in those areas of code where bug is seen.|
|issues are being closed |3|Closed 20 issues. <br> An open issue is closed only after verified by one of the members.|
|DOI badge: exists|3|Evidence in readME.https://github.com/MeryHarikaG/SimplyClip-proj2/tree/Group10DeveloperBranch#readme|
|Docs: doco generated , format not ugly  |3|Evidence in ReadME.https://github.com/MeryHarikaG/SimplyClip-proj2/tree/Group10DeveloperBranch#readme|
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation)  |3|Description for functions given in the ReadME.https://github.com/MeryHarikaG/SimplyClip-proj2/blob/Group10DeveloperBranch/Docs/FUNCTION_DESCRIPTION.md||
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z|3|  |
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing |3|Evidence in ReadME.|
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code. |3|Evidence in ReadME.https://github.com/MeryHarikaG/SimplyClip-proj2/tree/Group10DeveloperBranch#readme|
|Use of version control tools|3|https://github.com/MeryHarikaG/SimplyClip-proj2 \|
|Use of style checkers |3| Used Javascript standard style for style checking, this can be done using npm command.Evidence in ReadME.https://github.com/MeryHarikaG/SimplyClip-proj2/tree/Group10DeveloperBranch#style-checker-and-analyzer|
|Use of code formatters. |3|We used ```Prettier``` library to format the code in the project. <br> Evidence in ReadME.https://github.com/MeryHarikaG/SimplyClip-proj2/tree/Group10DeveloperBranch#code-formatter|
|Use of syntax checkers. |3| ```eslint``` library automatically checks for programatic and syntax errors. There is config file for eslint in the project folder.https://github.com/MeryHarikaG/SimplyClip-proj2/tree/Group10DeveloperBranch#syntax-checker|
|Use of code coverage  |3| Used Selenium to test the code, and acheived code coverage of 88%.https://github.com/MeryHarikaG/SimplyClip-proj2/blob/Group10DeveloperBranch/coverage/seleniumTest.js.html|
|other automated analysis tools  |3| Used automated tools like Selenium for testing, and Github Workflow/Actions for CI/CD pipeline |
|test cases exist  |3| There are number of unit test cases and automated test cases using selenium which covers 88% of the code |
|test cases are routinely executed |3| Github actions are used. After every commit to main branch, automated scripts are run for test cases and a badge is shown in the main project folder and README to indicate if build is successful|
|the files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up  |3|Evidence in Contrbuting.md.https://github.com/MeryHarikaG/SimplyClip-proj2/blob/Group10DeveloperBranch/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-to-simplyclip-application|
|issues are discussed before they are closed |3| After a team member fix the issue, a PR is raised, and the code is reviewed by one of the team members. If any issue is observed, it is communicated through comments in the issue. Once good to be closed, developer is tagged in order to notify.|
|Chat channel exists|3|https://chat.whatsapp.com/CcQJ1y1LjzRFgbpe7tvOuB|
|test cases:.a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases. |3| We ensured that every part of the code works correctly by using selenium test| suite. But Whenever a test case is failed an issue is added in the issues section.https://github.com/MeryHarikaG/SimplyClip-proj2/tree/Group10DeveloperBranch/test|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files|3|1. All the members of the team have set up environments setup locally. <br> 2. Everyone is using the same IDE, packages and tech stack to build the project. <br> 3. Everyone has installed the chrome extension and using that extension.|
|evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people) |3|1. All the members of the team have set up environments setup locally. <br> 2. Everyone is using the same IDE, packages and tech stack to build the project. <br> 3. Everyone has installed the chrome extension and using that extension.|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)|3|1. All the members of the team have set up environments setup locally. <br> 2. Everyone is using the same IDE, packages and tech stack to build the project. <br> 3. Everyone has installed the chrome extension and using that extension.|
|evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base |3|1. We assign issues in Github and start working on that. <br> 2. The commit history of different members can be seen.|
